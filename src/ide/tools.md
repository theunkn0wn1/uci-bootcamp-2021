# Tools of the trade

IDEs integrate multiple tools to make programming easier.

- For compiled languages like c++ or Java, you need a compiler.
- For an interpreted language like Python, you need an interpreter.
- Frequently, build systems are used to simplify build processies.
    - CMake
    - Make
    - Bazel
    - Gradle
    - Maven
    - etc...
- Well written code has a test suite, so the developer needs a way to run those tests.
  - They also need ways of easily interpreting test results
  - Test runners often have unique syntax or features
- Debuggers.
  - GDB (C++, Rust, etc.)
  - PDB (Python)
  - JDB (Java)
  - Etc...
- Version Control!
  - Git
  - Subversion
  - Team Foundation Server
  - etc...
  
- Specific to data-science:
  - integration with libraries!
  - data viewers!

None of this covers the code editor window!
 - Syntax highlighting!
 - Static Analysis
 - Code generation
 - Refactoring
 - Templates!
 - Structural Analysis
