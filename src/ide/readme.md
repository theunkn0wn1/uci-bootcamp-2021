# Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

As Software Engineers write code, they frequently use a wide range of tools such as linters, compilers,
static analyzers, debuggers, etc.

Most of these tools can be run stand-alone from the command line, but is often not as effective as if
the tools can be baked into their code editor.

IDEs provide rich integration of both code editing features, bringing tools such as static analysis
tooling and debuggers into the same program and window.

What are these tools i hear you ask? Next chapter we will discuss [the tools of the trade](tools.md).
