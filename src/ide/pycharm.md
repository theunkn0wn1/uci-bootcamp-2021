# PyCharm

For this presentation, I will be presenting using one set of IDEs made by the company Jetbrains.

Specifically, I will be using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), which is their Python IDE.

This is a professional grade IDE, which you can get for
free [as students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/)
