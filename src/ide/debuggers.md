# Debuggers

As you write more and more complex code, it is often times necessary to emit diagnostic information in
the middle of the program.

For instance, you might want to spot-check the algorithm by emiting an intermediate result from a
larger computation. Another case is in a large server application, and something is not behaving as
anticipated, so you need to know what the program thinks its doing.
