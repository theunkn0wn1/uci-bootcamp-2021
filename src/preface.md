# Preface

This document is still a WIP, some pages are incomplete or missing

## Purpose

This document is intended to give an introduction into [Python](https://www.python.org/), the
programming language. It further aims to introduce the reader to some of the core tools and
applications of Python as it relates to Scientific computing.

This document is not an exhaustive guide to Python as a whole, and as such many parts of the language
will not be addressed here.

This document is also not a how-to, though the author has kept the syntax used as simple as possible
and commented the code extensively.

## Intended Audience

The author prepared this document with students of the Physical Sciences in mind.

It is assumed the reader does not know Python, but has been previously exposed to logic and some programming concepts. As such, the
first section has been dedicated to explaining the core syntax and basic terminology of the language,
which serve as the bedrock the Scientific Computing builds off of. The author firmly believes that
teaching the Scientific Computing stack in a vacuum is not beneficial to the student.
