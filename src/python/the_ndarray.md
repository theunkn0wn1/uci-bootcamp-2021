# Numpy and the `ndarray`

When working with large amounts of data, the built-in python datastructures begin to show their limitations.

 - The standard `list` is designed for heterogenous data, meaning it uses memory less efficiently than something designed to work with homogenous numerical data.
 - Numpy's array structures are optimized for doing mathematics such as linear algebra
 - They are the backbone of many SciPy libraries and data structures.
