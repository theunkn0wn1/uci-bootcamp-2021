# Pip Third party libraries

Beyond what is provided by python itself via
its [built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) methods and
its [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) components, Python benefits from an active
community of developers who write and maintain plethora of libraries.

- Need to read from a serial device? [PySerial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) has you covered.
- Want to get started with Machine Learning? The [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries are the two popular options.
- Want a Webserver implemented in Python? Choose
  from [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
  and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the two most common options.
- Doing Scientific computing: the SciPy community [has you covered.](https://www.scipy.org/)
  Need to do math with
  quaternions? [There is a library for that](https://github.com/KieranWynn/pyquaternion)

I could go on, but we would be here all day. One of the many strengths of Python is it has excellent
library support.

Instead, this section will cover some predominant libraries with an emphasis in Scientific Computing.

> Odds are if you need to do something that isn't covered by standard library components, python has a library for that.


## Installing third-party libraries
Installing third-party libraries depends entirely on what [Dependency Management]() system you choose to use.
Both [Anaconda]() and [CPython]() have different sets of tools available for this, please see the [Dependency Management]() section for more details.
