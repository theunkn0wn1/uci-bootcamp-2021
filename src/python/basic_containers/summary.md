# Basic containers
- A [`Container`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Container) is a type that *contains* other objects.

Python has a large collection of built-in container types usable for various functions.

This document will only highlight three of the most useful containers, as judged by this document's
author:
 - The [list](lists.md)
 - The [dict]()
 - The [set](sets.md)
